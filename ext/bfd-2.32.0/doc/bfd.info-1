1 Introduction
**************

BFD is a package which allows applications to use the same routines to
operate on object files whatever the object file format.  A new object
file format can be supported simply by creating a new BFD back end and
adding it to the library.

   BFD is split into two parts: the front end, and the back ends (one
for each object file format).
   * The front end of BFD provides the interface to the user. It manages
     memory and various canonical data structures. The front end also
     decides which back end to use and when to call back end routines.

   * The back ends provide BFD its view of the real world. Each back
     end provides a set of calls which the BFD front end can use to
     maintain its canonical form. The back ends also may keep around
     information for their own use, for greater efficiency.

1.1 History
===========

One spur behind BFD was the desire, on the part of the GNU 960 team at
Intel Oregon, for interoperability of applications on their COFF and
b.out file formats.  Cygnus was providing GNU support for the team, and
was contracted to provide the required functionality.

   The name came from a conversation David Wallace was having with
Richard Stallman about the library: RMS said that it would be quite
hard--David said "BFD".  Stallman was right, but the name stuck.

   At the same time, Ready Systems wanted much the same thing, but for
different object file formats: IEEE-695, Oasys, Srecords, a.out and 68k
coff.

   BFD was first implemented by members of Cygnus Support; Steve
Chamberlain (`sac@cygnus.com'), John Gilmore (`gnu@cygnus.com'), K.
Richard Pixley (`rich@cygnus.com') and David Henkel-Wallace
(`gumby@cygnus.com').

1.2 How To Use BFD
==================

To use the library, include `bfd.h' and link with `libbfd.a'.

   BFD provides a common interface to the parts of an object file for a
calling application.

   When an application successfully opens a target file (object,
archive, or whatever), a pointer to an internal structure is returned.
This pointer points to a structure called `bfd', described in `bfd.h'.
Our convention is to call this pointer a BFD, and instances of it
within code `abfd'.  All operations on the target object file are
applied as methods to the BFD.  The mapping is defined within `bfd.h'
in a set of macros, all beginning with `bfd_' to reduce namespace
pollution.

   For example, this sequence does what you would probably expect:
return the number of sections in an object file attached to a BFD
`abfd'.

     #include "bfd.h"

     unsigned int number_of_sections (abfd)
     bfd *abfd;
     {
       return bfd_count_sections (abfd);
     }

   The abstraction used within BFD is that an object file has:

   * a header,

   * a number of sections containing raw data (*note Sections::),

   * a set of relocations (*note Relocations::), and

   * some symbol information (*note Symbols::).
   Also, BFDs opened for archives have the additional attribute of an
index and contain subordinate BFDs. This approach is fine for a.out and
coff, but loses efficiency when applied to formats such as S-records and
IEEE-695.

1.3 What BFD Version 2 Can Do
=============================

When an object file is opened, BFD subroutines automatically determine
the format of the input object file.  They then build a descriptor in
memory with pointers to routines that will be used to access elements of
the object file's data structures.

   As different information from the object files is required, BFD
reads from different sections of the file and processes them.  For
example, a very common operation for the linker is processing symbol
tables.  Each BFD back end provides a routine for converting between
the object file's representation of symbols and an internal canonical
format. When the linker asks for the symbol table of an object file, it
calls through a memory pointer to the routine from the relevant BFD
back end which reads and converts the table into a canonical form.  The
linker then operates upon the canonical form. When the link is finished
and the linker writes the output file's symbol table, another BFD back
end routine is called to take the newly created symbol table and
convert it into the chosen output format.

File: bfd.info,  Node: BFD information loss,  Next: Canonical format,  Up: What BFD Version 2 Can Do

1.3.1 Information Loss
----------------------

_Information can be lost during output._ The output formats supported
by BFD do not provide identical facilities, and information which can
be described in one form has nowhere to go in another format. One
example of this is alignment information in `b.out'. There is nowhere
in an `a.out' format file to store alignment information on the
contained data, so when a file is linked from `b.out' and an `a.out'
image is produced, alignment information will not propagate to the
output file. (The linker will still use the alignment information
internally, so the link is performed correctly).

   Another example is COFF section names. COFF files may contain an
unlimited number of sections, each one with a textual section name. If
the target of the link is a format which does not have many sections
(e.g., `a.out') or has sections without names (e.g., the Oasys format),
the link cannot be done simply. You can circumvent this problem by
describing the desired input-to-output section mapping with the linker
command language.

   _Information can be lost during canonicalization._ The BFD internal
canonical form of the external formats is not exhaustive; there are
structures in input formats for which there is no direct representation
internally.  This means that the BFD back ends cannot maintain all
possible data richness through the transformation between external to
internal and back to external formats.

   This limitation is only a problem when an application reads one
format and writes another.  Each BFD back end is responsible for
maintaining as much data as possible, and the internal BFD canonical
form has structures which are opaque to the BFD core, and exported only
to the back ends. When a file is read in one format, the canonical form
is generated for BFD and the application. At the same time, the back
end saves away any information which may otherwise be lost. If the data
is then written back in the same format, the back end routine will be
able to use the canonical form provided by the BFD core as well as the
information it prepared earlier.  Since there is a great deal of
commonality between back ends, there is no information lost when
linking or copying big endian COFF to little endian COFF, or `a.out' to
`b.out'.  When a mixture of formats is linked, the information is only
lost from the files whose format differs from the destination.

1.3.2 The BFD canonical object-file format
------------------------------------------

The greatest potential for loss of information occurs when there is the
least overlap between the information provided by the source format,
that stored by the canonical format, and that needed by the destination
format. A brief description of the canonical form may help you
understand which kinds of data you can count on preserving across
conversions.  

_files_
     Information stored on a per-file basis includes target machine
     architecture, particular implementation format type, a demand
     pageable bit, and a write protected bit.  Information like Unix
     magic numbers is not stored here--only the magic numbers' meaning,
     so a `ZMAGIC' file would have both the demand pageable bit and the
     write protected text bit set.  The byte order of the target is
     stored on a per-file basis, so that big- and little-endian object
     files may be used with one another.

_sections_
     Each section in the input file contains the name of the section,
     the section's original address in the object file, size and
     alignment information, various flags, and pointers into other BFD
     data structures.

_symbols_
     Each symbol contains a pointer to the information for the object
     file which originally defined it, its name, its value, and various
     flag bits.  When a BFD back end reads in a symbol table, it
     relocates all symbols to make them relative to the base of the
     section where they were defined.  Doing this ensures that each
     symbol points to its containing section.  Each symbol also has a
     varying amount of hidden private data for the BFD back end.  Since
     the symbol points to the original file, the private data format
     for that symbol is accessible.  `ld' can operate on a collection
     of symbols of wildly different formats without problems.

     Normal global and simple local symbols are maintained on output,
     so an output file (no matter its format) will retain symbols
     pointing to functions and to global, static, and common variables.
     Some symbol information is not worth retaining; in `a.out', type
     information is stored in the symbol table as long symbol names.
     This information would be useless to most COFF debuggers; the
     linker has command-line switches to allow users to throw it away.

     There is one word of type information within the symbol, so if the
     format supports symbol type information within symbols (for
     example, COFF, Oasys) and the type is simple enough to fit within
     one word (nearly everything but aggregates), the information will
     be preserved.

_relocation level_
     Each canonical BFD relocation record contains a pointer to the
     symbol to relocate to, the offset of the data to relocate, the
     section the data is in, and a pointer to a relocation type
     descriptor. Relocation is performed by passing messages through
     the relocation type descriptor and the symbol pointer. Therefore,
     relocations can be performed on output data using a relocation
     method that is only available in one of the input formats. For
     instance, Oasys provides a byte relocation format.  A relocation
     record requesting this relocation type would point indirectly to a
     routine to perform this, so the relocation may be performed on a
     byte being written to a 68k COFF file, even though 68k COFF has no
     such relocation type.

_line numbers_
     Object formats can contain, for debugging purposes, some form of
     mapping between symbols, source line numbers, and addresses in the
     output file.  These addresses have to be relocated along with the
     symbol information.  Each symbol with an associated list of line
     number records points to the first record of the list.  The head
     of a line number list consists of a pointer to the symbol, which
     allows finding out the address of the function whose line number
     is being described. The rest of the list is made up of pairs:
     offsets into the section and line numbers. Any format which can
     simply derive this information can pass it successfully between
     formats.

2.2 Error reporting
===================

Most BFD functions return nonzero on success (check their individual
documentation for precise semantics).  On an error, they call
`bfd_set_error' to set an error condition that callers can check by
calling `bfd_get_error'.  If that returns `bfd_error_system_call', then
check `errno'.

   The easiest way to report a BFD error to the user is to use
`bfd_perror'.

2.2.1 Type `bfd_error_type'
---------------------------

The values returned by `bfd_get_error' are defined by the enumerated
type `bfd_error_type'.


     typedef enum bfd_error
     {
       bfd_error_no_error = 0,
       bfd_error_system_call,
       bfd_error_invalid_target,
       bfd_error_wrong_format,
       bfd_error_wrong_object_format,
       bfd_error_invalid_operation,
       bfd_error_no_memory,
       bfd_error_no_symbols,
       bfd_error_no_armap,
       bfd_error_no_more_archived_files,
       bfd_error_malformed_archive,
       bfd_error_missing_dso,
       bfd_error_file_not_recognized,
       bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized,
       bfd_error_no_contents,
       bfd_error_nonrepresentable_section,
       bfd_error_no_debug_section,
       bfd_error_bad_value,
       bfd_error_file_truncated,
       bfd_error_file_too_big,
       bfd_error_on_input,
       bfd_error_invalid_error_code
     }
     bfd_error_type;
   
2.2.1.1 `bfd_get_error'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_error_type bfd_get_error (void);
   *Description*
Return the current BFD error condition.

2.2.1.2 `bfd_set_error'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_error (bfd_error_type error_tag);
   *Description*
Set the BFD error condition to be ERROR_TAG.

   ERROR_TAG must not be bfd_error_on_input.  Use bfd_set_input_error
for input errors instead.

2.2.1.3 `bfd_set_input_error'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_input_error (bfd *input, bfd_error_type error_tag);
   *Description*
Set the BFD error condition to be bfd_error_on_input.  INPUT is the
input bfd where the error occurred, and ERROR_TAG the bfd_error_type
error.

2.2.1.4 `bfd_errmsg'
....................

*Synopsis*
     const char *bfd_errmsg (bfd_error_type error_tag);
   *Description*
Return a string describing the error ERROR_TAG, or the system error if
ERROR_TAG is `bfd_error_system_call'.

2.2.1.5 `bfd_perror'
....................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_perror (const char *message);
   *Description*
Print to the standard error stream a string describing the last BFD
error that occurred, or the last system error if the last BFD error was
a system call failure.  If MESSAGE is non-NULL and non-empty, the error
string printed is preceded by MESSAGE, a colon, and a space.  It is
followed by a newline.

2.2.2 BFD error handler
-----------------------

Some BFD functions want to print messages describing the problem.  They
call a BFD error handler function.  This function may be overridden by
the program.

   The BFD error handler acts like vprintf.


     typedef void (*bfd_error_handler_type) (const char *, va_list);
   
2.2.2.1 `_bfd_error_handler'
............................

*Synopsis*
     void _bfd_error_handler (const char *fmt, ...) ATTRIBUTE_PRINTF_1;
   *Description*
This is the default routine to handle BFD error messages.  Like fprintf
(stderr, ...), but also handles some extra format specifiers.

   %pA section name from section.  For group components, prints group
name too.  %pB file name from bfd.  For archive components, prints
archive too.

   Beware: Only supports a maximum of 9 format arguments.

2.2.2.2 `bfd_set_error_handler'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_error_handler_type bfd_set_error_handler (bfd_error_handler_type);
   *Description*
Set the BFD error handler function.  Returns the previous function.

2.2.2.3 `bfd_set_error_program_name'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_error_program_name (const char *);
   *Description*
Set the program name to use when printing a BFD error.  This is printed
before the error message followed by a colon and space.  The string
must not be changed after it is passed to this function.

2.2.3 BFD assert handler
------------------------

If BFD finds an internal inconsistency, the bfd assert handler is
called with information on the BFD version, BFD source file and line.
If this happens, most programs linked against BFD are expected to want
to exit with an error, or mark the current BFD operation as failed, so
it is recommended to override the default handler, which just calls
_bfd_error_handler and continues.


     typedef void (*bfd_assert_handler_type) (const char *bfd_formatmsg,
                                              const char *bfd_version,
                                              const char *bfd_file,
                                              int bfd_line);
   
2.2.3.1 `bfd_set_assert_handler'
................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_assert_handler_type bfd_set_assert_handler (bfd_assert_handler_type);
   *Description*
Set the BFD assert handler function.  Returns the previous function.

2.3 Miscellaneous
=================

2.3.1 Miscellaneous functions
-----------------------------

2.3.1.1 `bfd_get_reloc_upper_bound'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     long bfd_get_reloc_upper_bound (bfd *abfd, asection *sect);
   *Description*
Return the number of bytes required to store the relocation information
associated with section SECT attached to bfd ABFD.  If an error occurs,
return -1.

2.3.1.2 `bfd_canonicalize_reloc'
................................

*Synopsis*
     long bfd_canonicalize_reloc
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, arelent **loc, asymbol **syms);
   *Description*
Call the back end associated with the open BFD ABFD and translate the
external form of the relocation information attached to SEC into the
internal canonical form.  Place the table into memory at LOC, which has
been preallocated, usually by a call to `bfd_get_reloc_upper_bound'.
Returns the number of relocs, or -1 on error.

   The SYMS table is also needed for horrible internal magic reasons.

2.3.1.3 `bfd_set_reloc'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_reloc
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, arelent **rel, unsigned int count);
   *Description*
Set the relocation pointer and count within section SEC to the values
REL and COUNT.  The argument ABFD is ignored.
     #define bfd_set_reloc(abfd, asect, location, count) \
            BFD_SEND (abfd, _bfd_set_reloc, (abfd, asect, location, count))

2.3.1.4 `bfd_set_file_flags'
............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_file_flags (bfd *abfd, flagword flags);
   *Description*
Set the flag word in the BFD ABFD to the value FLAGS.

   Possible errors are:
   * `bfd_error_wrong_format' - The target bfd was not of object format.

   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The target bfd was open for
     reading.

   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The flag word contained a bit
     which was not applicable to the type of file.  E.g., an attempt
     was made to set the `D_PAGED' bit on a BFD format which does not
     support demand paging.

2.3.1.5 `bfd_get_arch_size'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     int bfd_get_arch_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Returns the normalized architecture address size, in bits, as
determined by the object file's format.  By normalized, we mean either
32 or 64.  For ELF, this information is included in the header.  Use
bfd_arch_bits_per_address for number of bits in the architecture
address.

   *Returns*
Returns the arch size in bits if known, `-1' otherwise.

2.3.1.6 `bfd_get_sign_extend_vma'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     int bfd_get_sign_extend_vma (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Indicates if the target architecture "naturally" sign extends an
address.  Some architectures implicitly sign extend address values when
they are converted to types larger than the size of an address.  For
instance, bfd_get_start_address() will return an address sign extended
to fill a bfd_vma when this is the case.

   *Returns*
Returns `1' if the target architecture is known to sign extend
addresses, `0' if the target architecture is known to not sign extend
addresses, and `-1' otherwise.

2.3.1.7 `bfd_set_start_address'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_start_address (bfd *abfd, bfd_vma vma);
   *Description*
Make VMA the entry point of output BFD ABFD.

   *Returns*
Returns `TRUE' on success, `FALSE' otherwise.

2.3.1.8 `bfd_get_gp_size'
.........................

*Synopsis*
     unsigned int bfd_get_gp_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP
register under MIPS ECOFF.  This is typically set by the `-G' argument
to the compiler, assembler or linker.

2.3.1.9 `bfd_set_gp_size'
.........................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_gp_size (bfd *abfd, unsigned int i);
   *Description*
Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register
under ECOFF or MIPS ELF.  This is typically set by the `-G' argument to
the compiler, assembler or linker.

2.3.1.10 `bfd_scan_vma'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_vma bfd_scan_vma (const char *string, const char **end, int base);
   *Description*
Convert, like `strtoul', a numerical expression STRING into a `bfd_vma'
integer, and return that integer.  (Though without as many bells and
whistles as `strtoul'.)  The expression is assumed to be unsigned
(i.e., positive).  If given a BASE, it is used as the base for
conversion.  A base of 0 causes the function to interpret the string in
hex if a leading "0x" or "0X" is found, otherwise in octal if a leading
zero is found, otherwise in decimal.

   If the value would overflow, the maximum `bfd_vma' value is returned.

2.3.1.11 `bfd_copy_private_header_data'
.......................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_copy_private_header_data (bfd *ibfd, bfd *obfd);
   *Description*
Copy private BFD header information from the BFD IBFD to the the BFD
OBFD.  This copies information that may require sections to exist, but
does not require symbol tables.  Return `true' on success, `false' on
error.  Possible error returns are:

   * `bfd_error_no_memory' - Not enough memory exists to create private
     data for OBFD.

     #define bfd_copy_private_header_data(ibfd, obfd) \
            BFD_SEND (obfd, _bfd_copy_private_header_data, \
                      (ibfd, obfd))

2.3.1.12 `bfd_copy_private_bfd_data'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_copy_private_bfd_data (bfd *ibfd, bfd *obfd);
   *Description*
Copy private BFD information from the BFD IBFD to the the BFD OBFD.
Return `TRUE' on success, `FALSE' on error.  Possible error returns are:

   * `bfd_error_no_memory' - Not enough memory exists to create private
     data for OBFD.

     #define bfd_copy_private_bfd_data(ibfd, obfd) \
            BFD_SEND (obfd, _bfd_copy_private_bfd_data, \
                      (ibfd, obfd))

2.3.1.13 `bfd_set_private_flags'
................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_private_flags (bfd *abfd, flagword flags);
   *Description*
Set private BFD flag information in the BFD ABFD.  Return `TRUE' on
success, `FALSE' on error.  Possible error returns are:

   * `bfd_error_no_memory' - Not enough memory exists to create private
     data for OBFD.

     #define bfd_set_private_flags(abfd, flags) \

2.3.1.27 `bfd_get_mtime'
........................

*Synopsis*
     long bfd_get_mtime (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return the file modification time (as read from the file system, or
from the archive header for archive members).

2.3.1.28 `bfd_get_size'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     ufile_ptr bfd_get_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return the file size (as read from file system) for the file associated
with BFD ABFD.

   The initial motivation for, and use of, this routine is not so we
can get the exact size of the object the BFD applies to, since that
might not be generally possible (archive members for example).  It
would be ideal if someone could eventually modify it so that such
results were guaranteed.

   Instead, we want to ask questions like "is this NNN byte sized
object I'm about to try read from file offset YYY reasonable?"  As as
example of where we might do this, some object formats use string
tables for which the first `sizeof (long)' bytes of the table contain
the size of the table itself, including the size bytes.  If an
application tries to read what it thinks is one of these string tables,
without some way to validate the size, and for some reason the size is
wrong (byte swapping error, wrong location for the string table, etc.),
the only clue is likely to be a read error when it tries to read the
table, or a "virtual memory exhausted" error when it tries to allocate
15 bazillon bytes of space for the 15 bazillon byte table it is about
to read.  This function at least allows us to answer the question, "is
the size reasonable?".

2.3.1.29 `bfd_get_file_size'
............................

*Synopsis*
     ufile_ptr bfd_get_file_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return the file size (as read from file system) for the file associated
with BFD ABFD.  It supports both normal files and archive elements.

2.3.1.30 `bfd_mmap'
...................

*Synopsis*
     void *bfd_mmap (bfd *abfd, void *addr, bfd_size_type len,
         int prot, int flags, file_ptr offset,
         void **map_addr, bfd_size_type *map_len);
   *Description*
Return mmap()ed region of the file, if possible and implemented.  LEN
and OFFSET do not need to be page aligned.  The page aligned address
and length are written to MAP_ADDR and MAP_LEN.

2.4 Memory Usage
================

BFD keeps all of its internal structures in obstacks. There is one
obstack per open BFD file, into which the current state is stored. When
a BFD is closed, the obstack is deleted, and so everything which has
been allocated by BFD for the closing file is thrown away.

   BFD does not free anything created by an application, but pointers
into `bfd' structures become invalid on a `bfd_close'; for example,
after a `bfd_close' the vector passed to `bfd_canonicalize_symtab' is
still around, since it has been allocated by the application, but the
data that it pointed to are lost.

   The general rule is to not close a BFD until all operations dependent
upon data from the BFD have been completed, or all the data from within
the file has been copied. To help with the management of memory, there
is a function (`bfd_alloc_size') which returns the number of bytes in
obstacks associated with the supplied BFD. This could be used to select
the greediest open BFD, close it to reclaim the memory, perform some
operation and reopen the BFD again, to get a fresh copy of the data
structures.

2.5 Initialization
==================

2.5.1 Initialization functions
------------------------------

These are the functions that handle initializing a BFD.

2.5.1.1 `bfd_init'
..................

*Synopsis*
     unsigned int bfd_init (void);
   *Description*
This routine must be called before any other BFD function to initialize
magical internal data structures.  Returns a magic number, which may be
used to check that the bfd library is configured as expected by users.

     /* Value returned by bfd_init.  */

     #define BFD_INIT_MAGIC (sizeof (struct bfd_section))


File: bfd.info,  Node: Sections,  Next: Symbols,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: BFD front end

2.6 Sections
============

The raw data contained within a BFD is maintained through the section
abstraction.  A single BFD may have any number of sections.  It keeps
hold of them by pointing to the first; each one points to the next in
the list.

   Sections are supported in BFD in `section.c'.

* Section Input::
* Section Output::
* typedef asection::
* section prototypes::


File: bfd.info,  Node: Section Input,  Next: Section Output,  Prev: Sections,  Up: Sections

2.6.1 Section input
-------------------

When a BFD is opened for reading, the section structures are created
and attached to the BFD.

   Each section has a name which describes the section in the outside
world--for example, `a.out' would contain at least three sections,
called `.text', `.data' and `.bss'.

   Names need not be unique; for example a COFF file may have several
sections named `.data'.

   Sometimes a BFD will contain more than the "natural" number of
sections. A back end may attach other sections containing constructor
data, or an application may add a section (using `bfd_make_section') to
the sections attached to an already open BFD. For example, the linker
creates an extra section `COMMON' for each input file's BFD to hold
information about common storage.

   The raw data is not necessarily read in when the section descriptor
is created. Some targets may leave the data in place until a
`bfd_get_section_contents' call is made. Other back ends may read in
all the data at once.  For example, an S-record file has to be read
once to determine the size of the data.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Section Output,  Next: typedef asection,  Prev: Section Input,  Up: Sections

2.6.2 Section output
--------------------

To write a new object style BFD, the various sections to be written
have to be created. They are attached to the BFD in the same way as
input sections; data is written to the sections using
`bfd_set_section_contents'.

   Any program that creates or combines sections (e.g., the assembler
and linker) must use the `asection' fields `output_section' and
`output_offset' to indicate the file sections to which each section
must be written.  (If the section is being created from scratch,
`output_section' should probably point to the section itself and
`output_offset' should probably be zero.)

   The data to be written comes from input sections attached (via
`output_section' pointers) to the output sections.  The output section
structure can be considered a filter for the input section: the output
section determines the vma of the output data and the name, but the
input section determines the offset into the output section of the data
to be written.

   E.g., to create a section "O", starting at 0x100, 0x123 long,
containing two subsections, "A" at offset 0x0 (i.e., at vma 0x100) and
"B" at offset 0x20 (i.e., at vma 0x120) the `asection' structures would
look like:

        section name          "A"
          output_offset   0x00
          size            0x20
          output_section ----------->  section name    "O"
                                  |    vma             0x100
        section name          "B" |    size            0x123
          output_offset   0x20    |
          size            0x103   |
          output_section  --------|

2.6.3 Link orders
-----------------

The data within a section is stored in a "link_order".  These are much
like the fixups in `gas'.  The link_order abstraction allows a section
to grow and shrink within itself.

   A link_order knows how big it is, and which is the next link_order
and where the raw data for it is; it also points to a list of
relocations which apply to it.

   The link_order is used by the linker to perform relaxing on final
code.  The compiler creates code which is as big as necessary to make
it work without relaxing, and the user can select whether to relax.
Sometimes relaxing takes a lot of time.  The linker runs around the
relocations to see if any are attached to data which can be shrunk, if
so it does it on a link_order by link_order basis.

        (bfd *abfd, const char *templat, int *count);
   *Description*
Invent a section name that is unique in ABFD by tacking a dot and a
digit suffix onto the original TEMPLAT.  If COUNT is non-NULL, then it
specifies the first number tried as a suffix to generate a unique name.
The value pointed to by COUNT will be incremented in this case.

2.6.5.7 `bfd_make_section_old_way'
..................................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_make_section_old_way (bfd *abfd, const char *name);
   *Description*
Create a new empty section called NAME and attach it to the end of the
chain of sections for the BFD ABFD. An attempt to create a section with
a name which is already in use returns its pointer without changing the
section chain.

   It has the funny name since this is the way it used to be before it
was rewritten....

   Possible errors are:
   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - If output has already started for
     this BFD.

   * `bfd_error_no_memory' - If memory allocation fails.

2.6.5.8 `bfd_make_section_anyway_with_flags'
............................................

*Synopsis*

        (bfd *abfd, const char *name, flagword flags);
   *Description*
Create a new empty section called NAME and attach it to the end of the
chain of sections for ABFD.  Create a new section even if there is
already a section with that name.  Also set the attributes of the new
section to the value FLAGS.

   Return `NULL' and set `bfd_error' on error; possible errors are:
   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - If output has already started for
     ABFD.

   * `bfd_error_no_memory' - If memory allocation fails.

2.6.5.9 `bfd_make_section_anyway'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_make_section_anyway (bfd *abfd, const char *name);
   *Description*
Create a new empty section called NAME and attach it to the end of the
chain of sections for ABFD.  Create a new section even if there is
already a section with that name.

   Return `NULL' and set `bfd_error' on error; possible errors are:
   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - If output has already started for
     ABFD.

   * `bfd_error_no_memory' - If memory allocation fails.

2.6.5.10 `bfd_make_section_with_flags'
......................................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_make_section_with_flags
        (bfd *, const char *name, flagword flags);
   *Description*
Like `bfd_make_section_anyway', but return `NULL' (without calling
bfd_set_error ()) without changing the section chain if there is
already a section named NAME.  Also set the attributes of the new
section to the value FLAGS.  If there is an error, return `NULL' and set
`bfd_error'.

2.6.5.11 `bfd_make_section'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_make_section (bfd *, const char *name);
   *Description*
Like `bfd_make_section_anyway', but return `NULL' (without calling
bfd_set_error ()) without changing the section chain if there is
already a section named NAME.  If there is an error, return `NULL' and
set `bfd_error'.

2.6.5.12 `bfd_set_section_flags'
................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_section_flags
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, flagword flags);
   *Description*
Set the attributes of the section SEC in the BFD ABFD to the value
FLAGS. Return `TRUE' on success, `FALSE' on error. Possible error
returns are:

   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The section cannot have one or
     more of the attributes requested. For example, a .bss section in
     `a.out' may not have the `SEC_HAS_CONTENTS' field set.

2.6.5.13 `bfd_rename_section'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_rename_section
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, const char *newname);

         void (*func) (bfd *abfd, asection *sect, void *obj),
         void *obj);
   *Description*
Call the provided function FUNC for each section attached to the BFD
ABFD, passing OBJ as an argument. The function will be called as if by

            func (abfd, the_section, obj);

   This is the preferred method for iterating over sections; an
alternative would be to use a loop:

               asection *p;
               for (p = abfd->sections; p != NULL; p = p->next)
                  func (abfd, p, ...)

2.6.5.15 `bfd_sections_find_if'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_sections_find_if
        (bfd *abfd,
         bfd_boolean (*operation) (bfd *abfd, asection *sect, void *obj),
         void *obj);
   *Description*
Call the provided function OPERATION for each section attached to the
BFD ABFD, passing OBJ as an argument. The function will be called as if
by

            operation (abfd, the_section, obj);

   It returns the first section for which OPERATION returns true.

2.6.5.16 `bfd_set_section_size'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_section_size
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, bfd_size_type val);
   *Description*
Set SEC to the size VAL. If the operation is ok, then `TRUE' is
returned, else `FALSE'.

   Possible error returns:
   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - Writing has started to the BFD, so
     setting the size is invalid.

2.6.5.17 `bfd_set_section_contents'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_section_contents
        (bfd *abfd, asection *section, const void *data,
         file_ptr offset, bfd_size_type count);
   *Description*
Sets the contents of the section SECTION in BFD ABFD to the data
starting in memory at LOCATION.  The data is written to the output
section starting at offset OFFSET for COUNT octets.

   Normally `TRUE' is returned, but `FALSE' is returned if there was an
error.  Possible error returns are:
   * `bfd_error_no_contents' - The output section does not have the
     `SEC_HAS_CONTENTS' attribute, so nothing can be written to it.

   * `bfd_error_bad_value' - The section is unable to contain all of
     the data.

   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The BFD is not writeable.

   * and some more too.
   This routine is front end to the back end function
`_bfd_set_section_contents'.

2.6.5.18 `bfd_get_section_contents'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_get_section_contents
        (bfd *abfd, asection *section, void *location, file_ptr offset,
         bfd_size_type count);
   *Description*
Read data from SECTION in BFD ABFD into memory starting at LOCATION.
The data is read at an offset of OFFSET from the start of the input
section, and is read for COUNT bytes.

   If the contents of a constructor with the `SEC_CONSTRUCTOR' flag set
are requested or if the section does not have the `SEC_HAS_CONTENTS'
flag set, then the LOCATION is filled with zeroes. If no errors occur,
`TRUE' is returned, else `FALSE'.

2.6.5.19 `bfd_malloc_and_get_section'
.....................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_malloc_and_get_section
        (bfd *abfd, asection *section, bfd_byte **buf);
   *Description*
Read all data from SECTION in BFD ABFD into a buffer, *BUF, malloc'd by
this function.

2.6.5.20 `bfd_copy_private_section_data'
........................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_copy_private_section_data
        (bfd *ibfd, asection *isec, bfd *obfd, asection *osec);
   *Description*
Copy private section information from ISEC in the BFD IBFD to the
section OSEC in the BFD OBFD.  Return `TRUE' on success, `FALSE' on
error.  Possible error returns are:

   * `bfd_error_no_memory' - Not enough memory exists to create private
     data for OSEC.

     #define bfd_copy_private_section_data(ibfd, isection, obfd, osection) \
            BFD_SEND (obfd, _bfd_copy_private_section_data, \
                      (ibfd, isection, obfd, osection))

2.6.5.21 `bfd_generic_is_group_section'
.......................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_generic_is_group_section (bfd *, const asection *sec);
   *Description*
Returns TRUE if SEC is a member of a group.

2.6.5.22 `bfd_generic_discard_group'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_generic_discard_group (bfd *abfd, asection *group);
   *Description*

2.7 Symbols
===========

BFD tries to maintain as much symbol information as it can when it
moves information from file to file. BFD passes information to
applications though the `asymbol' structure. When the application
requests the symbol table, BFD reads the table in the native form and
translates parts of it into the internal format. To maintain more than
the information passed to applications, some targets keep some
information "behind the scenes" in a structure only the particular back
end knows about. For example, the coff back end keeps the original
symbol table structure as well as the canonical structure when a BFD is
read in. On output, the coff back end can reconstruct the output symbol
table so that no information is lost, even information unique to coff
which BFD doesn't know or understand. If a coff symbol table were read,
but were written through an a.out back end, all the coff specific
information would be lost. The symbol table of a BFD is not necessarily
read in until a canonicalize request is made. Then the BFD back end
fills in a table provided by the application with pointers to the
canonical information.  To output symbols, the application provides BFD
with a table of pointers to pointers to `asymbol's. This allows
applications like the linker to output a symbol as it was read, since
the "behind the scenes" information will be still available.

2.7.1 Reading symbols
---------------------

There are two stages to reading a symbol table from a BFD: allocating
storage, and the actual reading process. This is an excerpt from an
application which reads the symbol table:

              long storage_needed;
              asymbol **symbol_table;
              long number_of_symbols;
              long i;

              storage_needed = bfd_get_symtab_upper_bound (abfd);

              if (storage_needed < 0)
                FAIL

              if (storage_needed == 0)
                return;

              symbol_table = xmalloc (storage_needed);
                ...
              number_of_symbols =
                 bfd_canonicalize_symtab (abfd, symbol_table);

              if (number_of_symbols < 0)
                FAIL

              for (i = 0; i < number_of_symbols; i++)
                process_symbol (symbol_table[i]);

   All storage for the symbols themselves is in an objalloc connected
to the BFD; it is freed when the BFD is closed.

2.7.2 Writing symbols
---------------------

Writing of a symbol table is automatic when a BFD open for writing is
closed. The application attaches a vector of pointers to pointers to
symbols to the BFD being written, and fills in the symbol count. The
close and cleanup code reads through the table provided and performs
all the necessary operations. The BFD output code must always be
provided with an "owned" symbol: one which has come from another BFD,
or one which has been created using `bfd_make_empty_symbol'.  Here is an
example showing the creation of a symbol table with only one element:

            #include "sysdep.h"
            #include "bfd.h"
            int main (void)
            {
              bfd *abfd;
              asymbol *ptrs[2];
              asymbol *new;

              abfd = bfd_openw ("foo","a.out-sunos-big");
              bfd_set_format (abfd, bfd_object);
              new = bfd_make_empty_symbol (abfd);
              new->name = "dummy_symbol";
              new->section = bfd_make_section_old_way (abfd, ".text");
              new->flags = BSF_GLOBAL;
              new->value = 0x12345;

              ptrs[0] = new;
              ptrs[1] = 0;

              bfd_set_symtab (abfd, ptrs, 1);
              bfd_close (abfd);
              return 0;

   Many formats cannot represent arbitrary symbol information; for
instance, the `a.out' object format does not allow an arbitrary number
of sections. A symbol pointing to a section which is not one  of
`.text', `.data' or `.bss' cannot be described.

2.7.3 Mini Symbols
------------------

Mini symbols provide read-only access to the symbol table.  They use
less memory space, but require more time to access.  They can be useful
for tools like nm or objdump, which may have to handle symbol tables of
extremely large executables.

   The `bfd_read_minisymbols' function will read the symbols into
memory in an internal form.  It will return a `void *' pointer to a
block of memory, a symbol count, and the size of each symbol.  The
pointer is allocated using `malloc', and should be freed by the caller
when it is no longer needed.

   The function `bfd_minisymbol_to_symbol' will take a pointer to a
minisymbol, and a pointer to a structure returned by
`bfd_make_empty_symbol', and return a `asymbol' structure.  The return
value may or may not be the same as the value from
`bfd_make_empty_symbol' which was passed in.

          with the symbol.

          This field is *almost* redundant, since you can use section->owner
          instead, except that some symbols point to the global sections

   *Description*
Return TRUE if a symbol with the name NAME in the BFD ABFD is a
compiler generated local label, else return FALSE.  This just checks
whether the name has the form of a local label.

Create a new `asymbol' structure for the BFD ABFD and return a pointer
to it.

   This routine is necessary because each back end has private
information surrounding the `asymbol'. Building your own `asymbol' and
pointing to it will not create the private information, and will cause
problems later on.

2.8 Archives
============

*Description*
An archive (or library) is just another BFD.  It has a symbol table,
although there's not much a user program will do with it.

   The big difference between an archive BFD and an ordinary BFD is
that the archive doesn't have sections.  Instead it has a chain of BFDs
that are considered its contents.  These BFDs can be manipulated like
any other.  The BFDs contained in an archive opened for reading will
all be opened for reading.  You may put either input or output BFDs
into an archive opened for output; they will be handled correctly when
the archive is closed.

   Use `bfd_openr_next_archived_file' to step through the contents of
an archive opened for input.  You don't have to read the entire archive
if you don't want to!  Read it until you find what you want.

   A BFD returned by `bfd_openr_next_archived_file' can be closed
manually with `bfd_close'.  If you do not close it, then a second
iteration through the members of an archive may return the same BFD.
If you close the archive BFD, then all the member BFDs will
automatically be closed as well.

   Archive contents of output BFDs are chained through the
`archive_next' pointer in a BFD.  The first one is findable through the
`archive_head' slot of the archive.  Set it with `bfd_set_archive_head'
(q.v.).  A given BFD may be in only one open output archive at a time.

   As expected, the BFD archive code is more general than the archive
code of any given environment.  BFD archives may contain files of
different formats (e.g., a.out and coff) and even different
architectures.  You may even place archives recursively into archives!

   This can cause unexpected confusion, since some archive formats are
more expressive than others.  For instance, Intel COFF archives can
preserve long filenames; SunOS a.out archives cannot.  If you move a
file from the first to the second format and back again, the filename
may be truncated.  Likewise, different a.out environments have different
conventions as to how they truncate filenames, whether they preserve
directory names in filenames, etc.  When interoperating with native
tools, be sure your files are homogeneous.

   Beware: most of these formats do not react well to the presence of
spaces in filenames.  We do the best we can, but can't always handle
this case due to restrictions in the format of archives.  Many Unix
utilities are braindead in regards to spaces and such in filenames
anyway, so this shouldn't be much of a restriction.

   Archives are supported in BFD in `archive.c'.

2.8.1 Archive functions
-----------------------

2.8.1.1 `bfd_get_next_mapent'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     symindex bfd_get_next_mapent
        (bfd *abfd, symindex previous, carsym **sym);
   *Description*
Step through archive ABFD's symbol table (if it has one).  Successively
update SYM with the next symbol's information, returning that symbol's
(internal) index into the symbol table.

   Supply `BFD_NO_MORE_SYMBOLS' as the PREVIOUS entry to get the first
one; returns `BFD_NO_MORE_SYMBOLS' when you've already got the last one.

   A `carsym' is a canonical archive symbol.  The only user-visible
element is its name, a null-terminated string.

2.8.1.2 `bfd_set_archive_head'
..............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_archive_head (bfd *output, bfd *new_head);
   *Description*
Set the head of the chain of BFDs contained in the archive OUTPUT to
NEW_HEAD.

2.8.1.3 `bfd_openr_next_archived_file'
......................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openr_next_archived_file (bfd *archive, bfd *previous);
   *Description*
Provided a BFD, ARCHIVE, containing an archive and NULL, open an input
BFD on the first contained element and returns that.  Subsequent calls
should pass the archive and the previous return value to return a
created BFD to the next contained element.  NULL is returned when there
are no more.  Note - if you want to process the bfd returned by this
call be sure to call bfd_check_format() on it first.

2.9 File formats
================

A format is a BFD concept of high level file contents type. The formats
supported by BFD are:

   * `bfd_object'
   The BFD may contain data, symbols, relocations and debug info.

   * `bfd_archive'
   The BFD contains other BFDs and an optional index.

   * `bfd_core'
   The BFD contains the result of an executable core dump.

2.9.1 File format functions
---------------------------

2.9.1.1 `bfd_check_format'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_check_format (bfd *abfd, bfd_format format);
   *Description*
Verify if the file attached to the BFD ABFD is compatible with the
format FORMAT (i.e., one of `bfd_object', `bfd_archive' or `bfd_core').

   If the BFD has been set to a specific target before the call, only
the named target and format combination is checked. If the target has
not been set, or has been set to `default', then all the known target
backends is interrogated to determine a match.  If the default target
matches, it is used.  If not, exactly one target must recognize the
file, or an error results.

   The function returns `TRUE' on success, otherwise `FALSE' with one
of the following error codes:

   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - if `format' is not one of
     `bfd_object', `bfd_archive' or `bfd_core'.

   * `bfd_error_system_call' - if an error occured during a read - even
     some file mismatches can cause bfd_error_system_calls.

   * `file_not_recognised' - none of the backends recognised the file
     format.

   * `bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized' - more than one backend
     recognised the file format.

2.9.1.2 `bfd_check_format_matches'
..................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_check_format_matches
        (bfd *abfd, bfd_format format, char ***matching);
   *Description*
Like `bfd_check_format', except when it returns FALSE with `bfd_errno'
set to `bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized'.  In that case, if
MATCHING is not NULL, it will be filled in with a NULL-terminated list
of the names of the formats that matched, allocated with `malloc'.
Then the user may choose a format and try again.

   When done with the list that MATCHING points to, the caller should
free it.

2.9.1.3 `bfd_set_format'
........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_format (bfd *abfd, bfd_format format);
   *Description*
This function sets the file format of the BFD ABFD to the format
FORMAT. If the target set in the BFD does not support the format
requested, the format is invalid, or the BFD is not open for writing,
then an error occurs.

2.9.1.4 `bfd_format_string'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     const char *bfd_format_string (bfd_format format);
   *Description*
Return a pointer to a const string `invalid', `object', `archive',
`core', or `unknown', depending upon the value of FORMAT.

2.10 Relocations
================

BFD maintains relocations in much the same way it maintains symbols:
they are left alone until required, then read in en-masse and
translated into an internal form.  A common routine
`bfd_perform_relocation' acts upon the canonical form to do the fixup.

   Relocations are maintained on a per section basis, while symbols are
maintained on a per BFD basis.

   All that a back end has to do to fit the BFD interface is to create
a `struct reloc_cache_entry' for each relocation in a particular
section, and fill in the right bits of the structures.

   *Description*
Here is a description of each of the fields within an `arelent':

   * `sym_ptr_ptr'
   The symbol table pointer points to a pointer to the symbol
associated with the relocation request.  It is the pointer into the
table returned by the back end's `canonicalize_symtab' action. *Note
Symbols::. The symbol is referenced through a pointer to a pointer so
that tools like the linker can fix up all the symbols of the same name
by modifying only one pointer. The relocation routine looks in the
symbol and uses the base of the section the symbol is attached to and
the value of the symbol as the initial relocation offset. If the symbol
pointer is zero, then the section provided is looked up.

   * `address'
   The `address' field gives the offset in bytes from the base of the
section data which owns the relocation record to the first byte of
relocatable information. The actual data relocated will be relative to
this point; for example, a relocation type which modifies the bottom
two bytes of a four byte word would not touch the first byte pointed to
in a big endian world.

   * `addend'
   The `addend' is a value provided by the back end to be added (!)  to
the relocation offset. Its interpretation is dependent upon the howto.
For example, on the 68k the code:

             char foo[];
             main()
                     {
                     return foo[0x12345678];
                     }

   Could be compiled into:

             linkw fp,#-4
             moveb @#12345678,d0
             extbl d0
             unlk fp
             rts

   This could create a reloc pointing to `foo', but leave the offset in
the data, something like:

     RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
     offset   type      value
     00000006 32        _foo

     00000000 4e56 fffc          ; linkw fp,#-4
     00000004 1039 1234 5678     ; moveb @#12345678,d0
     0000000a 49c0               ; extbl d0
     0000000c 4e5e               ; unlk fp
     0000000e 4e75               ; rts

   Using coff and an 88k, some instructions don't have enough space in
them to represent the full address range, and pointers have to be
loaded in two parts. So you'd get something like:

             or.u     r13,r0,hi16(_foo+0x12345678)
             ld.b     r2,r13,lo16(_foo+0x12345678)
             jmp      r1

   This should create two relocs, both pointing to `_foo', and with
0x12340000 in their addend field. The data would consist of:

     RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
     offset   type      value
     00000002 HVRT16    _foo+0x12340000
     00000006 LVRT16    _foo+0x12340000

     00000000 5da05678           ; or.u r13,r0,0x5678
     00000004 1c4d5678           ; ld.b r2,r13,0x5678
     00000008 f400c001           ; jmp r1

   The relocation routine digs out the value from the data, adds it to
the addend to get the original offset, and then adds the value of
`_foo'. Note that all 32 bits have to be kept around somewhere, to cope
with carry from bit 15 to bit 16.

   One further example is the sparc and the a.out format. The sparc has
a similar problem to the 88k, in that some instructions don't have room
for an entire offset, but on the sparc the parts are created in odd
sized lumps. The designers of the a.out format chose to not use the
data within the section for storing part of the offset; all the offset
is kept within the reloc. Anything in the data should be ignored.

             save %sp,-112,%sp
             sethi %hi(_foo+0x12345678),%g2
             ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0x12345678)],%i0
             ret
             restore

   Both relocs contain a pointer to `foo', and the offsets contain junk.

     RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
     offset   type      value
     00000004 HI22      _foo+0x12345678
     00000008 LO10      _foo+0x12345678

     00000000 9de3bf90     ; save %sp,-112,%sp
     00000004 05000000     ; sethi %hi(_foo+0),%g2
     00000008 f048a000     ; ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0)],%i0
     0000000c 81c7e008     ; ret
     00000010 81e80000     ; restore

   * `howto'
   The `howto' field can be imagined as a relocation instruction. It is
a pointer to a structure which contains information on what to do with
all of the other information in the reloc record and data section. A
back end would normally have a relocation instruction set and turn
relocations into pointers to the correct structure on input - but it
would be possible to create each howto field on demand.

2.10.1.1 `enum complain_overflow'

2.10.1.2 `reloc_howto_type'

          for USE_REL == 1/0).  The value of this field is TRUE if the
          addend is recorded with the section contents; when performing a
          partial link (ld -r) the section contents (the data) will be

          However, the converse is not true: not all relocations of all ELF

2.10.1.3 `The HOWTO Macro'
..........................

*Description*
The HOWTO macro fills in a reloc_howto_type (a typedef for const struct
reloc_howto_struct).
     #define HOWTO(type, right, size, bits, pcrel, left, ovf, func, name,   \
                   inplace, src_mask, dst_mask, pcrel_off)                  \
       { (unsigned) type, size < 0 ? -size : size, bits, right, left, ovf,  \
         size < 0, pcrel, inplace, pcrel_off, src_mask, dst_mask, func, name }

   *Description*
This is used to fill in an empty howto entry in an array.
     #define EMPTY_HOWTO(C) \
       HOWTO ((C), 0, 0, 0, FALSE, 0, complain_overflow_dont, NULL, \
              NULL, FALSE, 0, 0, FALSE)

2.10.1.4 `bfd_get_reloc_size'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     unsigned int bfd_get_reloc_size (reloc_howto_type *);
   *Description*
For a reloc_howto_type that operates on a fixed number of bytes, this
returns the number of bytes operated on.

2.10.1.5 `arelent_chain'
........................

*Description*
How relocs are tied together in an `asection':
     typedef struct relent_chain
     {
       arelent relent;
       struct relent_chain *next;
     }
     arelent_chain;

2.10.1.6 `bfd_check_overflow'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_reloc_status_type bfd_check_overflow
        (enum complain_overflow how,
         unsigned int bitsize,
         unsigned int rightshift,
         unsigned int addrsize,
         bfd_vma relocation);
   *Description*
Perform overflow checking on RELOCATION which has BITSIZE significant
bits and will be shifted right by RIGHTSHIFT bits, on a machine with
addresses containing ADDRSIZE significant bits.  The result is either of
`bfd_reloc_ok' or `bfd_reloc_overflow'.

2.10.1.7 `bfd_reloc_offset_in_range'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_reloc_offset_in_range
        (reloc_howto_type *howto,
         bfd *abfd,
         asection *section,
         bfd_size_type offset);
   *Description*
Returns TRUE if the reloc described by HOWTO can be applied at OFFSET
octets in SECTION.

2.10.1.8 `bfd_perform_relocation'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_reloc_status_type bfd_perform_relocation
        (bfd *abfd,
         arelent *reloc_entry,
         void *data,
         asection *input_section,
         bfd *output_bfd,
         char **error_message);
   *Description*
If OUTPUT_BFD is supplied to this function, the generated image will be
relocatable; the relocations are copied to the output file after they
have been changed to reflect the new state of the world. There are two
ways of reflecting the results of partial linkage in an output file: by
modifying the output data in place, and by modifying the relocation
record.  Some native formats (e.g., basic a.out and basic coff) have no
way of specifying an addend in the relocation type, so the addend has
to go in the output data.  This is no big deal since in these formats
the output data slot will always be big enough for the addend. Complex
reloc types with addends were invented to solve just this problem.  The
ERROR_MESSAGE argument is set to an error message if this return
`bfd_reloc_dangerous'.

2.10.1.9 `bfd_install_relocation'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_reloc_status_type bfd_install_relocation
        (bfd *abfd,
         arelent *reloc_entry,
         void *data, bfd_vma data_start,
         asection *input_section,
         char **error_message);
   *Description*
This looks remarkably like `bfd_perform_relocation', except it does not
expect that the section contents have been filled in.  I.e., it's
suitable for use when creating, rather than applying a relocation.

   For now, this function should be considered reserved for the
assembler.

2.10.2 The howto manager
------------------------

When an application wants to create a relocation, but doesn't know what
the target machine might call it, it can find out by using this bit of
code.

2.10.2.1 `bfd_reloc_code_type'
..............................

*Description*
The insides of a reloc code.  The idea is that, eventually, there will
be one enumerator for every type of relocation we ever do.  Pass one of
these values to `bfd_reloc_type_lookup', and it'll return a howto
pointer.

   This does mean that the application must determine the correct
enumerator value; you can't get a howto pointer from a random set of
attributes.

   Here are the possible values for `enum bfd_reloc_code_real':

 -- : BFD_RELOC_64
 -- : BFD_RELOC_32
 -- : BFD_RELOC_26

 -- : BFD_RELOC_16_PCREL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_12_PCREL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_8_PCREL
     PC-relative relocations.  Sometimes these are relative to the
     address of the relocation itself; sometimes they are relative to
     the start of the section containing the relocation.  It depends on
     the specific target.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_32_SECREL
     Section relative relocations.  Some targets need this for DWARF2.

     Linkage-table relative.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_16_PCREL_S2
 -- : BFD_RELOC_23_PCREL_S2
     These PC-relative relocations are stored as word displacements -
     i.e., byte displacements shifted right two bits.  The 30-bit word
     displacement (<<32_PCREL_S2>> - 32 bits, shifted 2) is used on the
     SPARC.  (SPARC tools generally refer to this as <<WDISP30>>.)  The
     signed 16-bit displacement is used on the MIPS, and the 23-bit
     displacement is used on the Alpha.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_HI22
 -- : BFD_RELOC_LO10
     High 22 bits and low 10 bits of 32-bit value, placed into lower
     bits of the target word.  These are used on the SPARC.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_GPREL16
 -- : BFD_RELOC_GPREL32
     For systems that allocate a Global Pointer register, these are
     displacements off that register.  These relocation types are
     handled specially, because the value the register will have is
     decided relatively late.

     SPU Relocations.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP_HI16
     Alpha ECOFF and ELF relocations.  Some of these treat the symbol or
     "addend" in some special way.  For GPDISP_HI16 ("gpdisp")
     relocations, the symbol is ignored when writing; when reading, it
     will be the absolute section symbol.  The addend is the
     displacement in bytes of the "lda" instruction from the "ldah"
     instruction (which is at the address of this reloc).

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP_LO16
     For GPDISP_LO16 ("ignore") relocations, the symbol is handled as
     with GPDISP_HI16 relocs.  The addend is ignored when writing the
     relocations out, and is filled in with the file's GP value on
     reading, for convenience.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP
     The ELF GPDISP relocation is exactly the same as the GPDISP_HI16
     relocation except that there is no accompanying GPDISP_LO16
     relocation.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LITERAL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_ELF_LITERAL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LITUSE
     The Alpha LITERAL/LITUSE relocs are produced by a symbol reference;
     the assembler turns it into a LDQ instruction to load the address
     of the symbol, and then fills in a register in the real
     instruction.

     The LITERAL reloc, at the LDQ instruction, refers to the .lita
     section symbol.  The addend is ignored when writing, but is filled
     in with the file's GP value on reading, for convenience, as with
     the GPDISP_LO16 reloc.

     The ELF_LITERAL reloc is somewhere between 16_GOTOFF and
     GPDISP_LO16.  It should refer to the symbol to be referenced, as
     with 16_GOTOFF, but it generates output not based on the position
     within the .got section, but relative to the GP value chosen for
     the file during the final link stage.

     The LITUSE reloc, on the instruction using the loaded address,
     gives information to the linker that it might be able to use to
     optimize away some literal section references.  The symbol is
     ignored (read as the absolute section symbol), and the "addend"
     indicates the type of instruction using the register: 1 - "memory"
     fmt insn 2 - byte-manipulation (byte offset reg) 3 - jsr (target
     of branch)

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_HINT
     The HINT relocation indicates a value that should be filled into
     the "hint" field of a jmp/jsr/ret instruction, for possible branch-
     prediction logic which may be provided on some processors.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LINKAGE
     The LINKAGE relocation outputs a linkage pair in the object file,
     which is filled by the linker.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_CODEADDR
     The CODEADDR relocation outputs a STO_CA in the object file, which
     is filled by the linker.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPREL_HI16
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPREL_LO16
     The GPREL_HI/LO relocations together form a 32-bit offset from the
     GP register.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_BRSGP
     Like BFD_RELOC_23_PCREL_S2, except that the source and target must
     share a common GP, and the target address is adjusted for
     STO_ALPHA_STD_GPLOAD.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_NOP
     The NOP relocation outputs a NOP if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^21.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_BSR
     The BSR relocation outputs a BSR if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^21.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LDA
     The LDA relocation outputs a LDA if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^16.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_BOH
     The BOH relocation outputs a BSR if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^21, or else a hint.

     IBM 370/390 relocations

 -- : BFD_RELOC_CTOR
     The type of reloc used to build a constructor table - at the moment
     probably a 32 bit wide absolute relocation, but the target can
     choose.  It generally does map to one of the other relocation
     types.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ARM_PCREL_BRANCH
     ARM 26 bit pc-relative branch.  The lowest two bits must be zero
     and are not stored in the instruction.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ARM_PCREL_BLX
     ARM 26 bit pc-relative branch.  The lowest bit must be zero and is
     not stored in the instruction.  The 2nd lowest bit comes from a 1
     bit field in the instruction.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_THUMB_PCREL_BLX
     Thumb 22 bit pc-relative branch.  The lowest bit must be zero and
     is not stored in the instruction.  The 2nd lowest bit comes from a
     1 bit field in the instruction.

     Thumb 7-, 9-, 12-, 20-, 23-, and 25-bit pc-relative branches.  The
     lowest bit must be zero and is not stored in the instruction.
     Note that the corresponding ELF R_ARM_THM_JUMPnn constant has an
     "nn" one smaller in all cases.  Note further that BRANCH23
     corresponds to R_ARM_THM_CALL.

     These two relocations are used by the linker to determine which of
     the entries in a C++ virtual function table are actually used.
     When the -gc-sections option is given, the linker will zero out
     the entries that are not used, so that the code for those
     functions need not be included in the output.

     VTABLE_INHERIT is a zero-space relocation used to describe to the
     linker the inheritance tree of a C++ virtual function table.  The
     relocation's symbol should be the parent class' vtable, and the
     relocation should be located at the child vtable.

     VTABLE_ENTRY is a zero-space relocation that describes the use of a
     virtual function table entry.  The reloc's symbol should refer to
     the table of the class mentioned in the code.  Off of that base,
     an offset describes the entry that is being used.  For Rela hosts,
     this offset is stored in the reloc's addend.  For Rel hosts, we
     are forced to put this offset in the reloc's section offset.

2.11.1.5 `generic_core_file_matches_executable_p'
.................................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean generic_core_file_matches_executable_p

   *Description*
Return TRUE if the core file attached to CORE_BFD was generated by a
run of the executable file attached to EXEC_BFD.  The match is based on
executable basenames only.

   Note: When not able to determine the core file failing command or
the executable name, we still return TRUE even though we're not sure
that core file and executable match.  This is to avoid generating a
false warning in situations where we really don't know whether they
match or not.

2.12 Targets
============

*Description*
Each port of BFD to a different machine requires the creation of a
target back end. All the back end provides to the root part of BFD is a
structure containing pointers to functions which perform certain low
level operations on files. BFD translates the applications's requests
through a pointer into calls to the back end routines.

   When a file is opened with `bfd_openr', its format and target are
unknown. BFD uses various mechanisms to determine how to interpret the
file. The operations performed are:

   * Create a BFD by calling the internal routine `_bfd_new_bfd', then
     call `bfd_find_target' with the target string supplied to
     `bfd_openr' and the new BFD pointer.

   * If a null target string was provided to `bfd_find_target', look up
     the environment variable `GNUTARGET' and use that as the target
     string.

   * If the target string is still `NULL', or the target string is
     `default', then use the first item in the target vector as the
     target type, and set `target_defaulted' in the BFD to cause
     `bfd_check_format' to loop through all the targets.  *Note
     bfd_target::.  *Note Formats::.

   * Otherwise, inspect the elements in the target vector one by one,
     until a match on target name is found. When found, use it.

   * Otherwise return the error `bfd_error_invalid_target' to
     `bfd_openr'.

   * `bfd_openr' attempts to open the file using `bfd_open_file', and
     returns the BFD.
   Once the BFD has been opened and the target selected, the file
format may be determined. This is done by calling `bfd_check_format' on
the BFD with a suggested format.  If `target_defaulted' has been set,
each possible target type is tried to see if it recognizes the
specified format.  `bfd_check_format' returns `TRUE' when the caller
guesses right.

* bfd_target::

2.12.1 bfd_target
-----------------

*Description*
This structure contains everything that BFD knows about a target. It
includes things like its byte order, name, and which routines to call
to do various operations.

   Every BFD points to a target structure with its `xvec' member.

   The macros below are used to dispatch to functions through the
`bfd_target' vector. They are used in a number of macros further down
in `bfd.h', and are also used when calling various routines by hand
inside the BFD implementation.  The ARGLIST argument must be
parenthesized; it contains all the arguments to the called function.

   They make the documentation (more) unpleasant to read, so if someone
wants to fix this and not break the above, please do.
     #define BFD_SEND(bfd, message, arglist) \
       ((*((bfd)->xvec->message)) arglist)

     #ifdef DEBUG_BFD_SEND
     #undef BFD_SEND
     #define BFD_SEND(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd) && (bfd)->xvec && (bfd)->xvec->message) ? \
         ((*((bfd)->xvec->message)) arglist) : \
         (bfd_assert (__FILE__,__LINE__), NULL))
     #endif
   For operations which index on the BFD format:
     #define BFD_SEND_FMT(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd)->xvec->message[(int) ((bfd)->format)]) arglist)

     #ifdef DEBUG_BFD_SEND
     #undef BFD_SEND_FMT
     #define BFD_SEND_FMT(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd) && (bfd)->xvec && (bfd)->xvec->message) ? \
        (((bfd)->xvec->message[(int) ((bfd)->format)]) arglist) : \
        (bfd_assert (__FILE__,__LINE__), NULL))
     #endif
   This is the structure which defines the type of BFD this is.  The
`xvec' member of the struct `bfd' itself points here.  Each module that
implements access to a different target under BFD, defines one of these.

   FIXME, these names should be rationalised with the names of the
entry points which call them. Too bad we can't have one macro to define
them both!

   A pointer to an alternative bfd_target in case the current one is not

and little endian code, and target chosen by the linker has the wrong
endianness.  The function open_output() in ld/ldlang.c uses this field
to find an alternative output format that is suitable.

2.12.1.1 `bfd_set_default_target'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_default_target (const char *name);
   *Description*
Set the default target vector to use when recognizing a BFD.  This
takes the name of the target, which may be a BFD target name or a
configuration triplet.

2.12.1.2 `bfd_find_target'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     const bfd_target *bfd_find_target (const char *target_name, bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return a pointer to the transfer vector for the object target named
TARGET_NAME.  If TARGET_NAME is `NULL', choose the one in the
environment variable `GNUTARGET'; if that is null or not defined, then
choose the first entry in the target list.  Passing in the string
"default" or setting the environment variable to "default" will cause
the first entry in the target list to be returned, and
"target_defaulted" will be set in the BFD if ABFD isn't `NULL'.  This
causes `bfd_check_format' to loop over all the targets to find the one
that matches the file being read.

2.12.1.3 `bfd_get_target_info'
..............................

*Synopsis*
     const bfd_target *bfd_get_target_info (const char *target_name,
         bfd *abfd,
         bfd_boolean *is_bigendian,
         int *underscoring,
         const char **def_target_arch);
   *Description*
Return a pointer to the transfer vector for the object target named
TARGET_NAME.  If TARGET_NAME is `NULL', choose the one in the
environment variable `GNUTARGET'; if that is null or not defined, then
choose the first entry in the target list.  Passing in the string
"default" or setting the environment variable to "default" will cause
the first entry in the target list to be returned, and
"target_defaulted" will be set in the BFD if ABFD isn't `NULL'.  This
causes `bfd_check_format' to loop over all the targets to find the one
that matches the file being read.  If IS_BIGENDIAN is not `NULL', then
set this value to target's endian mode. True for big-endian, FALSE for
little-endian or for invalid target.  If UNDERSCORING is not `NULL',
then set this value to target's underscoring mode. Zero for
none-underscoring, -1 for invalid target, else the value of target
vector's symbol underscoring.  If DEF_TARGET_ARCH is not `NULL', then
set it to the architecture string specified by the target_name.

2.12.1.4 `bfd_target_list'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     const char ** bfd_target_list (void);
   *Description*
Return a freshly malloced NULL-terminated vector of the names of all
the valid BFD targets. Do not modify the names.

2.12.1.5 `bfd_iterate_over_targets'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     const bfd_target *bfd_iterate_over_targets
        (int (*func) (const bfd_target *, void *),
         void *data);
   *Description*
Call FUNC for each target in the list of BFD target vectors, passing
DATA to FUNC.  Stop iterating if FUNC returns a non-zero result, and
return that target vector.  Return NULL if FUNC always returns zero.

2.12.1.6 `bfd_flavour_name'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     const char *bfd_flavour_name (enum bfd_flavour flavour);
   *Description*
Return the string form of FLAVOUR.
